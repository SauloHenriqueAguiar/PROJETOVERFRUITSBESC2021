# PROJETOVERFRUITSBESC2021
According to data, 49% of Brazilians throw food in the trash daily. In addition, there is a lot
of phenomenon called &quot;refrigerator blindness&quot; where people ignore various foods that are
present in the refrigerator, which leads to their rotting. Based on two problems: food waste
and rotting. Electrolux launched the &quot;Don&#39;t throw it away in the trash&quot; campaign, to make
people aware of how to reuse food. In this context, in order to resolve these issues, this
project aims to create a solution called VER.Fruits. This makes it possible to detect which
fruits are present, in a specific compartment created to put them, and also the ripeness levels
of each one. Three fruits were selected, for the first time, to this project: Apple, Banana and
Orange. The product developed will be aimed at the domestic public, and can be attached to
any refrigerator. This system will do an inference using neural networks and allow the user to
know, by an interface of mobile application, the classification obtained. Moreover, provide
tips on how to reuse these fruits, if they are at a high level of ripeness, from cooking recipes
to fertilization. The product has reduced hardware size and usage flexibility.
